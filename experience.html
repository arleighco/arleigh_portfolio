        <h2>A long, long time ago</h2>
        <p>At one point of my life I went to a prestigious design school. There was always something missing and the analytical piece of my brain fought often with the "feel good" aspect of art school and where graphic design was in the early 2000's. I burned out quickly and ended up managing small businesses, learning digital marketing on my own, and landing jobs at a couple of pretty amazing digital ad agencies. I ran large client accounts, set up best practices for performance based social media clients, and thrived in a life of playing mediator or coach between the creative, dev, and analytic teams. In 2013, after 10 years of not calling myself a "designer", I learned about the craft of <strong>User Experience</strong>. Since then, I have been learning and applying user experience, analytics, user interface design, information architecture, and front-end design.
